# Business-Consulting-Impact-Dashboard-

The Business Consulting Impact dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of sales performance across various dimensions, allowing stakeholders to analyse and understand the key factors influencing business outcomes. Here's a breakdown of the components and their functionalities:

Slicers:
The dashboard features four slicers enabling dynamic filtering based on different parameters: Country, Discount Brand, Product, and Segment. This interactivity empowers users to focus their analysis on specific regions, brands, products, or customer segments of interest.
Card Visuals:
Four card visuals display essential metrics:
Sum of Sales: Total revenue generated from sales.
Sum of Gross Sales: Total revenue before deducting any discounts or returns.
Sum of COGS (Cost of Goods Sold): Total cost incurred to produce or acquire the goods sold.
Sum of Profit: Total profit derived from sales after deducting COGS and any other expenses.
Line Chart:
The line chart illustrates the trend of sales over time, with the X-axis representing the date-month and the Y-axis indicating the sales figures for the years 2013 and 2014. This visualization helps in identifying seasonal patterns, trends, and year-over-year growth or decline in sales performance.
Clustered Bar Chart:
A clustered bar chart presents a comparison of sales between different countries for the years 2013 and 2014. Countries are represented on the Y-axis, while the X-axis displays the corresponding sales figures. This visualization facilitates the identification of top-performing countries and any shifts in sales distribution over the two years.
Table Visual:
The table visual provides a detailed breakdown of sales metrics by Segment and Product. It includes columns for Segment, Product, Sum of Gross Sales, Sum of Sales, and Sum of Profit. This tabular representation offers granular insights into the contribution of different product segments to overall sales performance, enabling deeper analysis and decision-making.
Overall, the Business Consulting Impact dashboard equips users with the tools to explore sales data from multiple perspectives, identify trends, and make informed business decisions based on actionable insights derived from the visualization of key metrics.
